### What I learned

I've learned how to change the growth direction for an element using Position relative and absolute, how to use background-image with two sentences using color and an image


```css
.newsletter {
        background-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent 50%, var(--white) 50%, var(--white) 100%), url('../img/newsletter.jpg');
    }
```
